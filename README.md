# Image-Segmentation-using-K-means
- Segmentation partitions an image into regions having similar visual appearance corresponding to parts of objects
- I will try to extract the most dominant K colors using the K-Means
- K-means can be applied with each pixel and will reassigned to the closest of the K Colors, leading to <em>Segmentation<em>
